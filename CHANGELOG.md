# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add the experimental public-web-client/password-session OAuth profile:
  exact redirect/issuer policy, explicit bound consent, S256 codes, opaque
  access tokens, rotating refresh and client-bound native revocation.
- Add bounded grant-discriminated parsing, OAuth-owned reveal-once token
  custody and historical/unknown outcomes without credential redelivery.
- Reject unselected grants, confidential issuance, OIDC/device profiles and
  unauthenticated introspection instead of advertising partial support.
